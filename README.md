# MachineLearning_DataMining
This is a Python Code to make a stock analyzes using ScikitLearn, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly. And an html Interface.

I deliberately cleaned some html 3D scatter graphps to make it easier to upload on github. You can use the source code to generate them again and copy paste in to their original locations.

When you are working with this project, be sure to define your workspace where the transactions2.csv file is.
